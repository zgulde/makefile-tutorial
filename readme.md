# A Bite-Sized Intro To Makefiles

This repo contains an introduction to makefiles. It uses the example of using
the command line tool [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert markdown files to
html. We assume you already have `pandoc` and installed.

This guide errs on the side of being incomplete and oversimplified for the sake
of clarity.

1. Clone this repo
1. `cd` into each directory
1. Read the `Makefile`
1. Read the `readme.md`
